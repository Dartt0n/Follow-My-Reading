# Follow My Reading :blue_book:

Follow My Reading provides a **API service** for our users to upload an image and audio of their reading session, and our service checks whether there are any mistakes in pronunciation in the audio.


## Here's how it works :gear:
- :sunrise: users can take **a photo of the page**
- :book: read the page **aloud**
- :microphone: record their **audio**
- :arrow_up: **upload image** and audio files to sever
- :park: server can **process image**
- :musical_note: server can **process audio**
- :frame_photo: server can **compare audio against image**
- :page_facing_up: server can **compare audio against text**
- :arrow_double_down: server can **extract audio** segments with requested phrases
